              From as far back as I can remember, I’ve been captivated by the inner workings of computers. As a child, I spent countless hours dismantling old computers, marveling at their components, and trying to understand what made them tick. My fascination with technology went hand in hand with my creativity—whether I was drawing, painting, building things, or even crafting my own toys from scratch, I was always eager to create.
          </p>
          <p>
              As a teenager, my curiosity for computers only deepened. I began teaching myself about hardware, software, and the fundamentals of technology. After completing high school, I realized that this passion could become a career. I started furthering my knowledge in 2021 by enrolling at <strong>Damelin College</strong>, where I earned a <strong>Further Education and Training Certificate: Information Technology: Technical Support</strong>. This qualification gave me a solid foundation in IT principles and strengthened my resolve to build a career in this field.
          </p>
          <p>
              While I enjoyed learning about IT support, I discovered a growing interest in <strong>web development</strong>—a field that allowed me to combine two of my favorite things: creating and building. Eager to explore this passion, I began diving into courses that helped me refine my skills. Over time, I’ve completed multiple certifications, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Developers - Johns Hopkins University</li>
              <li>Introduction to Front-End Development - Meta</li>
              <li>Introduction to HTML, CSS, & JavaScript - IBM</li>
              <li>Introduction to Web Development - UC Davis</li>
              <li>Learn Responsive Web Development from Scratch - Udemy</li>
              <li>Responsive Website Basics: Code with HTML & CSS - University of London</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              My journey is far from over. I am currently pursuing further studies at <strong>Boston City Campus</strong>, where I’m working towards a qualification in <strong>Systems Development</strong>. This program allows me to build on my technical knowledge while enhancing my ability to create dynamic, user-friendly web solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
              I remain committed to lifelong learning, constantly seeking new opportunities to grow and refine my skills. Whether it’s taking apart a computer, building a responsive website, or designing innovative solutions, my goal is to combine creativity and technology to make a lasting impact.
          </p>
          <p>
              This is only the beginning of my story, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me next!

              <p>
                  From a young age, I have always had a fascination with nature, including the ocean, plants, trees, and animals. I strongly believe in the importance of preserving and prolonging the life of nature. It’s not just about the beauty it provides but also its critical role in supporting all forms of life, including humans.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Nature is a lifeline for humanity. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we consume all come from the natural world. Trees and plants produce oxygen and help combat climate change, while oceans regulate temperatures and provide a habitat for diverse marine life. Animals contribute to the balance of ecosystems, and their well-being is directly linked to ours.
              </p>
              <p>
                  I have always been drawn to the creative and technical, but my connection with nature has shaped my perspective on the world. I believe that caring for nature is not just an option but a responsibility that every person shares. It’s a passion of mine to raise awareness about its importance and to ensure its sustainability for future generations.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Alongside my love for nature, my interest in computers, design, and technology has been a major driving force in my life. From taking apart computers as a child to creating modern, responsive websites as an adult, I have always combined curiosity and creativity in everything I do.
